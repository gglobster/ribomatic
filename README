This project consists of a library of packages and a main script that can be
run as a pipeline. The pipeline script is designed to take a set of Illumina
sequence reads (forward and reverse) of bacterial 16S rDNA sequences amplified
by PCR, process them (trim, QC and merge) and then identify OTUs against a
reference ribosomal database.

The primary application is to assess the diversity of bacterial populations in
environmental samples.

As of 15 Oct 2011 the project is in intense active development.
